Admin Page React Application



This project is a React-based Admin Panel designed to manage users, roles, and permissions. It includes functionality to define user roles and associated permissions, 
making it suitable for building access-controlled systems. A JSON Server is used to simulate APIs for development and testing.



User Management: Create, update, view, and delete users.
Role-Based Access Control: Assign roles to users with specific permissions.
Permission Management: Define and manage permissions (e.g., Read, Write, Delete).
Dynamic UI: Displays options and functionalities based on user roles.
Fake API Integration: Uses JSON Server for simulating REST API calls.
